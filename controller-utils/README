Q: Why do we have 2 tables --- v2pmaps (vector16) and voltab (hashtable) ?

A: v2pmaps stores the default 1:1 V2P mapping => (volID, vblkID) maps to pblkID
	whereas
   voltab stores mapping between vmname and volID

Firstly, If we want to lookup V2P mapping by (volID, vblkID) tuple, then we 
	need these 2 mappings to be maintained separately.

Secondly, even though in our implementation, we just lookup based on volID
	and retrieve entry from 1D vector, and it might seem that instead of
	volID into 1D vector, why dont we just use vmname into hash-table lookup,
	this is not a satisfactory way because a typical disk-controller would
	not receive a lookup request based on vmname. It is more likely that
	a lookup request based on volID (or some number) would be received.
	Based on this, we could even decide to use hash-table instead of
	vector16 for v2pmaps as well, but we still can not eliminate the 
	requirement of 2 lookup tables in our implementation. In any case,
	the access time for both arrays (vectors) and hash-tables is constant.

Note that the vmname => volID lookup is only done during initialization
of V2P maps. Once this is over, all traces will only mention volID and
all PROVIDED-based lookups would also use the v2pmaps only, not voltab.
